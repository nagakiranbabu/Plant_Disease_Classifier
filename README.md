# Plant Disease Classification Model

This repository contains the code for building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify different diseases in plants using images. The dataset used in this project is sourced from the PlantVillage dataset on Kaggle.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [PlantVillage dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/arjuntejaswi/plant-village), which contains images of healthy and diseased leaves. The images are categorized into three classes:
1. **Healthy**
2. **Early Blight**
3. **Late Blight**

## Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- Numpy

To install the required packages, run:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy
```

## Model Architecture

The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow and Keras. It consists of several convolutional layers with ReLU activation, followed by max-pooling layers. The final layers are fully connected, ending with a softmax activation function to output the class probabilities.

### Layers

- **Input Layer**: Resizes images to 256x256 and rescales pixel values to [0, 1].
- **Convolutional Layers**: Six convolutional layers with varying numbers of filters (32, 64).
- **Max-Pooling Layers**: Added after each convolutional layer to reduce the spatial dimensions.
- **Flatten Layer**: Converts the 2D matrix into a 1D vector.
- **Dense Layers**: Two dense layers, the first with 64 neurons and ReLU activation, and the final output layer with softmax activation for classification.

## Data Augmentation

To improve the model's performance, data augmentation techniques such as random flipping and random rotation were applied to the training dataset.

## Training

The model was trained for 50 epochs with a batch size of 32. The dataset was split into training (80%), validation (10%), and testing (10%) sets. The `adam` optimizer and `SparseCategoricalCrossentropy` loss function were used during training.

## Evaluation

The model achieved the following scores on the test dataset:

- **Test Loss**: 0.0063
- **Test Accuracy**: 1.0000

## Results

The training and validation accuracy and loss curves are plotted to visualize the modelâ€™s performance over the epochs. The final model can accurately classify diseases from the test set images.

## Inference

The notebook includes functions for running predictions on new images. The `predict` function takes a model and an image as input and returns the predicted class along with the confidence level.
